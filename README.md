# Custom CSS Injector

## How to Use
- Download a compatible userscript manager extension for your browser
- Popular options are:
  - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
  - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)
- Then simply add the Custom CSS Injector-1.0.user.js file from this repository
- On a webpage, click on your userscript manager extension
  - For Tampermonkey, it should look something like this: 
  <img  height="228" alt="2025-11-02 (09-42-58)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f1ad36-6d51-4098-9e2e-e330c6865bbf" />

  - Then click on "Edit Custom CSS..." to open a popup
  - You can input custom styles as per your need. Assume you are editing a .css file
  - Use the "Inspect" element feature on your browser to understand the website, if needed
  - Examples of some Custom Css I have made are given in "css-snippets" folder like:
    - chatgpt.css
    - docs-google.css
    - genius.css
    - twitch.css
- This can also be used to remove visual clutter or even ads, apart from changing background-color, font etc
